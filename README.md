### Install

**1/** First of all, _clone_ this repository.

**2/** _Run the command_ `yarn` (or npm install) to install dependencies.

**3/** After that, _run_ `yarn start` (or npm start) to start the local server. This will _open a window_ on your main browser. If not, open http://localhost:3000/.

### Structure

This web was created using `create-react-app`.
In the folder **public**, you will find the manifest and favicon.

The **src** folder contains the file **App.js** that is where the magic happens, in other words, where I load the _components_, _SCSS_ styles and the _API_.

Inside the folder src and from top to bottom, you can find the **api** where I fetch the data. The **components** folder with a Header.js file where I filter the gnomes by profession and search name; Cards.js to show basic information of all gnomes distributed in cards; Modal.js to show basic characteristics for every gnome; and an index.js where I load this three components, and send them to App.js.

I used three _fonts_: 'SF Display' (bold and regular) and 'Sigmar One'(regular). This fonts are loaded in the fonts.scss file, inside styles/assets/fonts.scss, using _font-face_.

In the **folder** images, I loaded all the images that appear on the modal and logo. All the images are SVG to make web weigh less.

Finally, in **styles** folder, is where I decided to put together all SCSS files by components. In assets, you would find a \_mixins.scss file that I used to create SCSS variables for colors and fonts. And the file color-palette.scss contains some variables for colors that I used for styling.

### Testing

I used **Jest** (from _create-react-app_) with **Enzyme**.
Use `yarn test`(or npm test) in your terminal to pass the tests.
